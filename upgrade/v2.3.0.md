# MainNet v2.2.x -> v2.3.0 Upgrade Instructions

The following instructions will allow patch your node from v2.2.x to v2.3.0, and pre-download v2.3.0 upgrade binaries. The binaries must be placed in `~/.carbon/cosmovisor/upgrades/v2.3.0` directory so that cosmovisor will switch to the right binaries at v2.3.0 upgrade block height.

The v2.3.0 upgrade will be scheduled for [block 24952002](https://scan.carbon.network).

**:exclamation: Run these steps in sequence, do not skip any steps! :exclamation:**

1. Download and upgrade using the v2.3.0 release bundle.

    The [v2.3.0 release bundle](https://github.com/Switcheo/carbon-bootstrap/releases/tag/v2.3.0) contains v2.3.0 binaries.

    We will be placing v2.3.0 binaries (`carbond`) in the `cosmovisor/upgrades/v2.3.0` directory. Cosmovisor will switch to the right binary during the upgrade block height.

    ```bash
    VERSION=2.3.0
    NETWORK=mainnet
    FILE=carbond${VERSION}-${NETWORK}.linux-$(dpkg --print-architecture).tar.gz
    wget https://github.com/Switcheo/carbon-bootstrap/releases/download/v${VERSION}/${FILE}
    tar -xvf ${FILE}
    rm ${FILE}
    mkdir -p ~/.carbon/cosmovisor/upgrades/v2.3.0/bin
    mv carbond ~/.carbon/cosmovisor/upgrades/v2.3.0/bin/carbond
    ```

    Note that v2.3.0 will be running automatically after block 24952002. You may check the version of your node after block 24952002.

2. Check that you have configured the right versions of `carbond` for `cosmovisor` to switch over correctly.

    Ensure that you have the right binaries installed under the `cosmovisor` directory:

    ```bash
    openssl sha256 ~/.carbon/cosmovisor/upgrades/v2.3.0/bin/carbond
    # arm64 e6e42f3d2fbea9c1320acd9e0bfacdbf13245739ec6c5f41bd63e6659d8419e5
    # amd64 029a1a19d6e2bc54d8657fd997b07324a8a64dac171748213581238b8339109d
    ```
