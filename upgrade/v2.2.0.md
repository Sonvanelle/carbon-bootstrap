# MainNet v2.1.x -> v2.2.0 Upgrade Instructions

The following instructions will allow patch your node from v2.1.x to v2.2.0, and pre-download v2.2.0 upgrade binaries. The binaries must be placed in `~/.carbon/cosmovisor/upgrades/v2.2.0` directory so that cosmovisor will switch to the right binaries at v2.2.0 upgrade block height.

The v2.2.0 upgrade will be scheduled for [block 22851250](https://scan.carbon.network).

**:exclamation: Run these steps in sequence, do not skip any steps! :exclamation:**

1. You may remove data that was backup during v2.1.0 upgrade

   ```bash
   ls -al ~/.carbon
   # If there's data-backup-xx, remove it.
   # E.g. Remove backup data-backup-2022-2-14:
   rm -rf ~/.carbon/data-backup-2022-2-14
   ```

2. Update systemd service to prevent backup from stalling upgrade.

    Add `Environment="UNSAFE_SKIP_BACKUP=true"`
    ```bash
    sudo vim /etc/systemd/system/carbond.service
    ```

    So that the file look like this:

    **Do not copy and paste the lines below into your shell**

    ```
    ...
    Environment="DAEMON_NAME=carbond"
    Environment="DAEMON_ALLOW_DOWNLOAD_BINARIES=true"
    Environment="UNSAFE_SKIP_BACKUP=true"
    ...
    ```

    Restart service to reflect config changes

    ```bash
    sudo systemctl daemon-reload
    ```

3. Upgrade to v2.1.1 binary

    This contains the preupgrade step that will be applied before v2.2.0

    ```bash
    VERSION=2.1.1
    MINOR=$(perl -pe 's/(?<=\d\.\d{1,2}\.)\d{1,2}/0/g' <<< $VERSION)
    NETWORK=mainnet
    FILE=carbond${VERSION}-${NETWORK}.linux-$(dpkg --print-architecture).tar.gz
    wget https://github.com/Switcheo/carbon-bootstrap/releases/download/v${VERSION}/${FILE}
    tar -xvf ${FILE}
    rm ${FILE}
    sudo service carbond stop
    mv carbond ~/.carbon/cosmovisor/upgrades/v${MINOR}/bin/carbond
    sudo service carbond start

    # Check that your chain is progressing. Might take a 1-2 minutes for p2p.
    tail -f /var/log/carbon/carbond.out.log /var/log/carbon/carbond.err.log
    ```

4. Check that you have configured the right versions of `carbond`.

    Ensure that you have the right binaries installed under the `cosmovisor` directory:

    ```bash
    openssl sha256 ~/.carbon/cosmovisor/current/bin/carbond
    # arm64 80c3af8812af3dc528e38429c4ae38b386cc0a60da884e0dc9c76a95236090cc
    # amd64 ed48038da496a8d1544f6dfee1b0b6071690a144617a8bc1d2e05cdbe6496772
    ```

5. Download and upgrade using the v2.2.0 release bundle.

    The [v2.2.0 release bundle](https://github.com/Switcheo/carbon-bootstrap/releases/tag/v2.2.0) contains v2.2.0 binaries.

    We will be placing v2.2.0 binaries (`carbond`) in the `cosmovisor/upgrades/v2.2.0` directory. Cosmovisor will switch to the right binary during the upgrade block height.

    ```bash
    VERSION=2.2.0
    NETWORK=mainnet
    FILE=carbond${VERSION}-${NETWORK}.linux-$(dpkg --print-architecture).tar.gz
    wget https://github.com/Switcheo/carbon-bootstrap/releases/download/v${VERSION}/${FILE}
    tar -xvf ${FILE}
    rm ${FILE}
    mkdir -p ~/.carbon/cosmovisor/upgrades/v2.2.0/bin
    mv carbond ~/.carbon/cosmovisor/upgrades/v2.2.0/bin/carbond
    ```

    Note that v2.2.0 will be running automatically after block 22851250. You may check the version of your node after block 22851250.

6. Check that you have configured the right versions of `carbond` for `cosmovisor` to switch over correctly.

    Ensure that you have the right binaries installed under the `cosmovisor` directory:

    ```bash
    openssl sha256 ~/.carbon/cosmovisor/upgrades/v2.2.0/bin/carbond
    # arm64 15e3125931ceaef927cb5da5c232cfae3123f47467df212364a8ddf6bdc9433f
    # amd64 7b2e254e54f7a2123b3e4a6307217dd774a67e67422063dcf45570098135d85a
    ```
