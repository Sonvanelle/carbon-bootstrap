# MainNet v2.6.x -> v2.7.0 Upgrade Instructions

The following instructions will allow patch your node from v2.6.x to v2.7.0, and pre-download v2.7.0 upgrade binaries. The binaries must be placed in `~/.carbon/cosmovisor/upgrades/v2.7.0` directory so that cosmovisor will switch to the right binaries at v2.7.0 upgrade block height.

The v2.7.0 upgrade will be scheduled for [block 28644360](https://scan.carbon.network).

**:exclamation: Run these steps in sequence, do not skip any steps! :exclamation:**

1. Download and upgrade using the v2.7.0 release bundle.

    The [v2.7.0 release bundle](https://github.com/Switcheo/carbon-bootstrap/releases/tag/v2.7.0) contains v2.7.0 binaries.

    We will be placing v2.7.0 binaries (`carbond`) in the `cosmovisor/upgrades/v2.7.0` directory. Cosmovisor will switch to the right binary during the upgrade block height.

    ```bash
    VERSION=2.7.0
    NETWORK=mainnet
    FILE=carbond${VERSION}-${NETWORK}.linux-$(dpkg --print-architecture).tar.gz
    wget https://github.com/Switcheo/carbon-bootstrap/releases/download/v${VERSION}/${FILE}
    tar -xvf ${FILE}
    rm ${FILE}
    mkdir -p ~/.carbon/cosmovisor/upgrades/v2.7.0/bin
    mv carbond ~/.carbon/cosmovisor/upgrades/v2.7.0/bin/carbond
    ```

    Note that v2.7.0 will be running automatically after block 28644360. You may check the version of your node after block 28644360.

2. Check that you have configured the right versions of `carbond` for `cosmovisor` to switch over correctly.

    Ensure that you have the right binaries installed under the `cosmovisor` directory:

    ```bash
    openssl sha256 ~/.carbon/cosmovisor/upgrades/v2.7.0/bin/carbond
    # arm64 77c013bcdd4d2368040c451c5cfed559175f87f65287616e3f00350f293eeb89
    # amd64 4e8dd507b9cc7f7e13da6bbc17459dcd96dfb395277fcc3c82c174a5279918ed
    ```
