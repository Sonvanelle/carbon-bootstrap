# MainNet v2.15.x -> v2.15.6 Upgrade Instructions

The following instructions will allow patch your node from v2.15.x to v2.15.6

**:exclamation: Run these steps in sequence, do not skip any steps! :exclamation:**

1. Ensure your node is caught up at height >= 34802692:

    ```bash
    tail -fn 10000  /var/log/carbon/carbond.*.log  | grep "block height"
    # [carbonstats:app] AppEndBlocker block height: 34802692`
    ```
    
    If it is not, do the below steps with `VERSION=2.15.5` first.

1. Download and upgrade using the v2.15.6 release bundle.

    The [v2.15.6 release bundle](https://github.com/Switcheo/carbon-bootstrap/releases/tag/v2.15.6) contains v2.15.6 binaries.

    We will be placing v2.15.6 binaries (`carbond`) in the `cosmovisor/upgrades/v2.15.0` directory.

    ```bash
    VERSION=2.15.6
    MINOR=2.15.0
    NETWORK=mainnet
    FILE=carbond${VERSION}-${NETWORK}.linux-$(dpkg --print-architecture).tar.gz
    wget https://github.com/Switcheo/carbon-bootstrap/releases/download/v${VERSION}/${FILE}
    tar -xvf ${FILE}
    rm ${FILE}
    sudo service carbond stop
    mv carbond ~/.carbon/cosmovisor/upgrades/v${MINOR}/bin/carbond
    openssl sha256 ~/.carbon/cosmovisor/upgrades/v2.15.0/bin/carbond
    sudo service carbond start
    ```

2. Check that you have configured the right versions of `carbond`.

    Ensure that you have the right binaries installed under the `cosmovisor` directory:

    ```bash
    openssl sha256 ~/.carbon/cosmovisor/upgrades/v2.15.0/bin/carbond
    # arm64 7ebbd5e5efff3c0f0fe370c5910a43742efa4a732fb97dcac7b76a3df61f9f1c
    # amd64 e6b16989bf8005275bdf98a432dce0e479953321ebda6443d20ed2ba0b2bffc7
    ```

3. Once done, check that node logs are normal and progressing:

    ```bash
    tail -f /var/log/carbon/carbond.*.log -n 500 | grep block
    ```
