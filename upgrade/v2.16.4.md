# MainNet v2.16.x -> v2.16.4 Upgrade Instructions

The following instructions will allow patch your node from v2.16.x to v2.16.4

**:exclamation: Run these steps in sequence, do not skip any steps! :exclamation:**

1. Download and upgrade using the v2.16.4 release bundle.

    The [v2.16.4 release bundle](https://github.com/Switcheo/carbon-bootstrap/releases/tag/v2.16.4) contains v2.16.4 binaries.

    We will be placing v2.16.4 binaries (`carbond`) in the `cosmovisor/upgrades/v2.16.0` directory.

    ```bash
    VERSION=2.16.4
    MINOR=2.16.0
    NETWORK=mainnet
    FILE=carbond${VERSION}-${NETWORK}.linux-$(dpkg --print-architecture).tar.gz
    wget https://github.com/Switcheo/carbon-bootstrap/releases/download/v${VERSION}/${FILE}
    tar -xvf ${FILE}
    rm ${FILE}
    sudo service carbond stop
    mv carbond ~/.carbon/cosmovisor/upgrades/v${MINOR}/bin/carbond
    openssl sha256 ~/.carbon/cosmovisor/upgrades/v2.16.0/bin/carbond
    ```

2. Check that you have configured the right versions of `carbond`.

    Ensure that you have the right binaries installed under the `cosmovisor` directory:

    ```bash
    openssl sha256 ~/.carbon/cosmovisor/upgrades/v2.16.0/bin/carbond
    # arm64 da38b1aee6e0d72bd8539c1a641f6053a9b0c55cc145bed3b342996b0f11afbb
    # amd64 2dba3f008e563e558ba1aedf35566286d621bbd9e263b9f29341233e2410e31b
    ```

3. Start the node:

    ```bash
    sudo service carbond start
    ```

4. Once done, check that node logs are normal and has progressed to 35915094 (may take awhile):

    ```bash
    tail -f /var/log/carbon/carbond.*.log -n 5000 | grep block
    # AppEndBlocker block height: 35915094, took 208.346467ms
    ```
