# MainNet v2.14.x -> v2.15.0 Upgrade Instructions

The following instructions will allow patch your node from v2.14.x to v2.15.0, and pre-download v2.15.0 upgrade binaries. The binaries must be placed in `~/.carbon/cosmovisor/upgrades/v2.15.0` directory so that cosmovisor will switch to the right binaries at v2.15.0 upgrade block height.

The v2.15.0 upgrade will be scheduled for [block 34604711](https://scan.carbon.network).

**:exclamation: Run these steps in sequence, do not skip any steps! :exclamation:**

1. Download and upgrade using the v2.15.0 release bundle.

    The [v2.15.0 release bundle](https://github.com/Switcheo/carbon-bootstrap/releases/tag/v2.15.0) contains v2.15.0 binaries.

    We will be placing v2.15.0 binaries (`carbond`) in the `cosmovisor/upgrades/v2.15.0` directory. Cosmovisor will switch to the right binary during the upgrade block height.

    ```bash
    VERSION=2.15.0
    NETWORK=mainnet
    FILE=carbond${VERSION}-${NETWORK}.linux-$(dpkg --print-architecture).tar.gz
    wget https://github.com/Switcheo/carbon-bootstrap/releases/download/v${VERSION}/${FILE}
    tar -xvf ${FILE}
    rm ${FILE}
    mkdir -p ~/.carbon/cosmovisor/upgrades/v2.15.0/bin
    mv carbond ~/.carbon/cosmovisor/upgrades/v2.15.0/bin/carbond
    ```

    Note that v2.15.0 will be running automatically after block 34604711. You may check the version of your node after block 34604711.

2. Check that you have configured the right versions of `carbond` for `cosmovisor` to switch over correctly.

    Ensure that you have the right binaries installed under the `cosmovisor` directory:

    ```bash
    openssl sha256 ~/.carbon/cosmovisor/upgrades/v2.15.0/bin/carbond
    # arm64 470f926d29e6eb29716e06826ee682d85fc936cac2ef3068c171e378fd42b8d9
    # amd64 69f9c61f1dad23a12222dccb488f43dc60fa97506f4830423613f91d1a90b15f
    ```
