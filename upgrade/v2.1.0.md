# MainNet v2.0.x -> v2.1.0 Upgrade Instructions

The following instructions will allow patch your node from v2.0.x to v2.1.0, and pre-download v2.1.0 upgrade binaries. The binaries must be placed in `~/.carbon/cosmovisor/upgrades/v2.1.0` directory so that cosmovisor will switch to the right binaries at v2.1.0 upgrade block height.

The v2.1.0 upgrade will be scheduled for [block 22587450](https://scan.carbon.network).

**:exclamation: Run these steps in sequence, do not skip any steps! :exclamation:**

1. Update systemd service to allow cosmovisor to auto download upgrade binaries if it does not exist.

    Add `Environment="DAEMON_ALLOW_DOWNLOAD_BINARIES=true"`
    ```bash
    sudo vim /etc/systemd/system/carbond.service
    ```

    So that the file look like this:

    **Do not copy and paste the lines below into your shell**

    ```
    ...
    Environment="DAEMON_NAME=carbond"
    Environment="DAEMON_ALLOW_DOWNLOAD_BINARIES=true"
    ...
    ```

    Restart service to reflect config changes

    ```bash
    sudo systemctl daemon-reload
    sudo systemctl restart carbond

    # Check that your chain is progressing. Might take a 1-2 minutes for p2p.
    tail -f /var/log/carbon/carbond.*
    ```

2. Download and upgrade using the v2.1.0 release bundle.

    The [v2.1.0 release bundle](https://github.com/Switcheo/carbon-bootstrap/releases/tag/v2.1.0) contains v2.1.0 binaries.

    We will be placing v2.1.0 binaries (`carbond`) in the `cosmovisor/upgrades/v2.1.0` directory. Cosmovisor will switch to the right binary during the upgrade block height.

    ```bash
    VERSION=2.1.0
    NETWORK=mainnet
    FILE=carbond${VERSION}-${NETWORK}.linux-$(dpkg --print-architecture).tar.gz
    wget https://github.com/Switcheo/carbon-bootstrap/releases/download/v${VERSION}/${FILE}
    tar -xvf ${FILE}
    rm ${FILE}
    mkdir -p ~/.carbon/cosmovisor/upgrades/v2.1.0/bin
    mv carbond ~/.carbon/cosmovisor/upgrades/v2.1.0/bin/carbond
    ```

    Note that v2.1.0 will be running automatically after block 22587450. You may check the version of your node after block 22587450.

3. Check that you have configured the right versions of `carbond` for `cosmovisor` to switch over correctly.

    Ensure that you have the right binaries installed under the `cosmovisor` directory:

    ```bash
    openssl sha256 ~/.carbon/cosmovisor/upgrades/v2.1.0/bin/carbond
    # arm64 3301a445f5f71183e7ad0014ff2e5e156b434ee6245bb9f895bb54f290a56d61
    # amd64 80ec1d0e07e97e825dfc597afc03e11ee5d5439f3e6922b40bcaa594748a4f1d
    ```
