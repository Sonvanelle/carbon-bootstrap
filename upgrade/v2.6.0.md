# MainNet v2.5.x -> v2.6.0 Upgrade Instructions

The following instructions will allow patch your node from v2.5.x to v2.6.0, and pre-download v2.6.0 upgrade binaries. The binaries must be placed in `~/.carbon/cosmovisor/upgrades/v2.6.0` directory so that cosmovisor will switch to the right binaries at v2.6.0 upgrade block height.

The v2.6.0 upgrade will be scheduled for [block 27895311](https://scan.carbon.network).

**:exclamation: Run these steps in sequence, do not skip any steps! :exclamation:**

1. Download and upgrade using the v2.6.0 release bundle.

    The [v2.6.0 release bundle](https://github.com/Switcheo/carbon-bootstrap/releases/tag/v2.6.0) contains v2.6.0 binaries.

    We will be placing v2.6.0 binaries (`carbond`) in the `cosmovisor/upgrades/v2.6.0` directory. Cosmovisor will switch to the right binary during the upgrade block height.

    ```bash
    VERSION=2.6.0
    NETWORK=mainnet
    FILE=carbond${VERSION}-${NETWORK}.linux-$(dpkg --print-architecture).tar.gz
    wget https://github.com/Switcheo/carbon-bootstrap/releases/download/v${VERSION}/${FILE}
    tar -xvf ${FILE}
    rm ${FILE}
    mkdir -p ~/.carbon/cosmovisor/upgrades/v2.6.0/bin
    mv carbond ~/.carbon/cosmovisor/upgrades/v2.6.0/bin/carbond
    ```

    Note that v2.6.0 will be running automatically after block 27895311. You may check the version of your node after block 27895311.

2. Check that you have configured the right versions of `carbond` for `cosmovisor` to switch over correctly.

    Ensure that you have the right binaries installed under the `cosmovisor` directory:

    ```bash
    openssl sha256 ~/.carbon/cosmovisor/upgrades/v2.6.0/bin/carbond
    # arm64 57b6c0c8a1546acccb15a5dd7e1cf1830483dfa2e40472c267f0ac8d5b1527f3
    # amd64 f93fc1c1b49b4ed81c1c163cf9d2e096cd8469fa5b33163d3b1d882500254d74
    ```
