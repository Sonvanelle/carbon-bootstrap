# MainNet v2.8.x -> v2.9.0 Upgrade Instructions

The following instructions will allow patch your node from v2.8.x to v2.9.0, and pre-download v2.9.0 upgrade binaries. The binaries must be placed in `~/.carbon/cosmovisor/upgrades/v2.9.0` directory so that cosmovisor will switch to the right binaries at v2.9.0 upgrade block height.

The v2.9.0 upgrade will be scheduled for [block 31113322](https://scan.carbon.network).

**:exclamation: Run these steps in sequence, do not skip any steps! :exclamation:**

1. Download and upgrade using the v2.9.0 release bundle.

    The [v2.9.0 release bundle](https://github.com/Switcheo/carbon-bootstrap/releases/tag/v2.9.0) contains v2.9.0 binaries.

    We will be placing v2.9.0 binaries (`carbond`) in the `cosmovisor/upgrades/v2.9.0` directory. Cosmovisor will switch to the right binary during the upgrade block height.

    ```bash
    VERSION=2.9.0
    NETWORK=mainnet
    FILE=carbond${VERSION}-${NETWORK}.linux-$(dpkg --print-architecture).tar.gz
    wget https://github.com/Switcheo/carbon-bootstrap/releases/download/v${VERSION}/${FILE}
    tar -xvf ${FILE}
    rm ${FILE}
    mkdir -p ~/.carbon/cosmovisor/upgrades/v2.9.0/bin
    mv carbond ~/.carbon/cosmovisor/upgrades/v2.9.0/bin/carbond
    ```

    Note that v2.9.0 will be running automatically after block 31113322. You may check the version of your node after block 31113322.

2. Check that you have configured the right versions of `carbond` for `cosmovisor` to switch over correctly.

    Ensure that you have the right binaries installed under the `cosmovisor` directory:

    ```bash
    openssl sha256 ~/.carbon/cosmovisor/upgrades/v2.9.0/bin/carbond
    # arm64 c658f7949199f7278e3be399edfe93faae0a87c2ca7eebcb05a4113d73f2befe
    # amd64 392dd97aa65b6a8160c8609a252e58ee548a818c1860f2ff2554eb7dc559634c
    ```
