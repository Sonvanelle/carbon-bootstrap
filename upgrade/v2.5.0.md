# MainNet v2.4.x -> v2.5.0 Upgrade Instructions

The following instructions will allow patch your node from v2.4.x to v2.5.0, and pre-download v2.5.0 upgrade binaries. The binaries must be placed in `~/.carbon/cosmovisor/upgrades/v2.5.0` directory so that cosmovisor will switch to the right binaries at v2.5.0 upgrade block height.

The v2.5.0 upgrade will be scheduled for [block 26681670](https://scan.carbon.network).

**:exclamation: Run these steps in sequence, do not skip any steps! :exclamation:**

1. Download and upgrade using the v2.5.0 release bundle.

    The [v2.5.0 release bundle](https://github.com/Switcheo/carbon-bootstrap/releases/tag/v2.5.0) contains v2.5.0 binaries.

    We will be placing v2.5.0 binaries (`carbond`) in the `cosmovisor/upgrades/v2.5.0` directory. Cosmovisor will switch to the right binary during the upgrade block height.

    ```bash
    VERSION=2.5.0
    NETWORK=mainnet
    FILE=carbond${VERSION}-${NETWORK}.linux-$(dpkg --print-architecture).tar.gz
    wget https://github.com/Switcheo/carbon-bootstrap/releases/download/v${VERSION}/${FILE}
    tar -xvf ${FILE}
    rm ${FILE}
    mkdir -p ~/.carbon/cosmovisor/upgrades/v2.5.0/bin
    mv carbond ~/.carbon/cosmovisor/upgrades/v2.5.0/bin/carbond
    ```

    Note that v2.5.0 will be running automatically after block 26681670. You may check the version of your node after block 26681670.

2. Check that you have configured the right versions of `carbond` for `cosmovisor` to switch over correctly.

    Ensure that you have the right binaries installed under the `cosmovisor` directory:

    ```bash
    openssl sha256 ~/.carbon/cosmovisor/upgrades/v2.5.0/bin/carbond
    # arm64 5d606ecfd5e611a26609bee103360631bc5d13d37016d29a9d32428c81d74e12
    # amd64 a693398928e26c634a3d651609e58182caea3468445d549d32a76d3431095b89
    ```
