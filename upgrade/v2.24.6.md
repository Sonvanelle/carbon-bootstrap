# MainNet v2.24.x -> v2.24.6 Upgrade Instructions

The following instructions will allow patch your node from v2.24.x to v2.24.6

**:exclamation: Run these steps in sequence, do not skip any steps! :exclamation:**

1. Download and upgrade using the v2.24.6 release bundle.

    The [v2.24.6 release bundle](https://github.com/Switcheo/carbon-bootstrap/releases/tag/v2.24.6) contains v2.24.6 binaries.

    We will be placing v2.24.6 binaries (`carbond`) in the `cosmovisor/upgrades/v2.24.0` directory.

    ```bash
    VERSION=2.24.6
    MINOR=2.24.0
    NETWORK=mainnet
    FILE=carbond${VERSION}-${NETWORK}.linux-$(dpkg --print-architecture).tar.gz
    wget https://github.com/Switcheo/carbon-bootstrap/releases/download/v${VERSION}/${FILE}
    tar -xvf ${FILE}
    rm ${FILE}
    sudo service carbond stop
    mv carbond ~/.carbon/cosmovisor/upgrades/v${MINOR}/bin/carbond
    openssl sha256 ~/.carbon/cosmovisor/upgrades/v2.24.0/bin/carbond
    ```

2. Check that you have configured the right versions of `carbond`.

    Ensure that you have the right binaries installed under the `cosmovisor` directory:

    ```bash
    openssl sha256 ~/.carbon/cosmovisor/upgrades/v2.24.0/bin/carbond
    # arm64 533bec06de204554823b6ea740bbfa58272dc6202bb26934aec8a3036762af3d
    # amd64 25050b1faeb0b4889bbc53c51e1dbf9792fa23cb9c85853d87ba818b829c1fa4
    ```

3. Start the node:

    ```bash
    sudo service carbond start
    ```
